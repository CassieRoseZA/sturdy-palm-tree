Please bear in mind that Agony is quite an "old school" game; non-linear, with a semi-open world, a lot of different paths, endings, exploration possibilities as well as secrets to uncover. Playing Agony is notably different than what you can get from modern, mostly linear and corridor-style horror games<h4>STORY MODE</h4>
You will begin your journey as a tormented soul within the depths of hell, without any memories about your past.
<br>

<br>
The special ability to control people on your path, and even possess simple minded demons, gives you the necessary measures to survive in the extreme conditions you are in.
<br>

<br>
By exploring the hostile environment and interacting with other weary souls of the hellscape, the hero will soon understand that there is only one way to escape from Hell, and it will require meeting the mystical Red Goddess.<h4>AGONY MODE</h4>

Agony features a full-fledged story mode as well as an open challenge system that
<br>
randomly generates levels for players to explore and survive to gain new Highscores. In
<br>
addition to featuring in countless “Most anticipated Horror Games 2018” lists, the kick
<br>
starter financed title is set to challenge players with its brutal and malevolent
<br>
environments. 
<br>

<br>
Agony throws you in the midst of hell where you strive to stay alive
<br>
and solve the riddle behind the mysterious Red Goddess; architect of this place of sorrow
<br>
and pain, and the sole entity with knowledge of how escape… but there is more to the
<br>
story than it seems. Haunted by nightmare creatures, You will gain the ability to possess
<br>
demons and other souls to find a way out of hell.

<br><br>
Mondain, second born of Wolfgang, a great king of old, wished to gain his brother's inheritance and so he used his great powers for evil, creating deep dungeons guarded by daemons and Balrogs. Now blood flowed freely in Akalabeth, and foul creatures soon came to roam near the surface. Mondain cast such sickness and pestilence upon Akalabeth, that both man and beast lived in constant fear. Thus was the Dark Age of Akalabeth.
<br><br>
There arose from the land a man, pure and just, to battle the Dark Lord. British, Champion of the White Light, did battle with Mondain deep within the labyrinth of dungeons, eventually driving him from Akalabeth forever. British of the White Light was proclaimed Lord British, Protector of Akalabeth. Alas, much damage had been suffered unto the lands. The Revival of Akalabest has begun.

Use your cunning and resources to kill or tame &amp; breed the leviathan dinosaurs and other primeval creatures roaming the land, and team up with or prey on hundreds of other players to survive, dominate... and escape!<br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/346110/extras/TameTrainBreedRide.png?t=1694646699" /><br><br>Dinosaurs, Creatures, &amp; Breeding! -- over 100+ creatures can be tamed using a challenging capture-&amp;-affinity process, involving weakening a feral creature to knock it unconscious, and then nursing it back to health with appropriate food. Once tamed, you can issue commands to your tames, which it may follow depending on how well you’ve tamed and trained it. Tames, which can continue to level-up and consume food, can also carry Inventory and Equipment such as Armor, carry prey back to your settlement depending on their strength, and larger tames can be ridden and directly controlled! Fly a Pterodactyl over the snow-capped mountains, lift allies over enemy walls, race through the jungle with a pack of Raptors, tromp through an enemy base along a gigantic brontosaurus, or chase down prey on the back of a raging T-Rex! Take part in a dynamic ecosystem life-cycle with its own predator &amp; prey hierarchies, where you are just one creature among many species struggling for dominance and survival. Tames can also be mated with the opposite gender, to selectively breed successive generations using a trait system based on recombinant genetic inheritance. This process includes both egg-based incubation and mammalian gestation lifecycles! Or put more simply, raise babies!<br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/346110/extras/FoodWaterTemp.png?t=1694646699" /><br><br>You must eat and drink to survive, with different kinds of plants &amp; meat having different nutritional properties, including human meat. Ensuring a supply of fresh water to your home and inventory is a pressing concern. All physical actions come at a cost of food and water, long-distance travel is fraught with subsistence peril! Inventory weight makes you move slower, and the day/night cycle along with randomized weather patterns add another layer of challenge by altering the temperature of the environment, causing you to hunger or thirst more quickly. Build a fire or shelter, and craft a large variety of customizable clothing &amp; armors, to help protect yourself against locational damage &amp; extreme temperatures using the dynamic indoor/outdoor insulation calculation system!<br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/346110/extras/HarvestBuildPaint.png?t=1694646699" /><br><br> By chopping down forests full of trees and mining metal and other precious resources, you can craft the parts to build massive multi-leveled structures composed of complex snap-linked parts, including ramps, beams, pillars, windows, doors, gates, remote gates, trapdoors, water pipes, faucets, generators, wires and all manner of electrical devices, and ladders among many other types. Structures have a load system to fall apart if enough support has been destroyed, so reinforcing your buildings is important. All structures and items can be painted to customize the look of your home, as well as placing dynamically per-pixel paintable signs, textual billboards, and other decorative objects. Shelter reduces the extremes of weather and provides security for yourself and your stash! Weapons, clothing &amp; armor gear can also be painted to express your own visual style.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/346110/extras/PlantFarmGrow.png?t=1694646699" /><br><br>Pick seeds from the wild vegetation around you, plant them in plots that you lay down, water them and nurture them with fertilizer (everything poops after consuming calories, which can then be composted, and some fertilizer is better than others). Tend to your crops and they will grow to produce delicious and rare fruits, which can also be used to cook a plethora of logical recipes and make useful tonics! Explore to find the rarest of plant seeds that have the most powerful properties! Vegetarians &amp; vegans can flourish, and it will be possible to master and conquer the ARK in a non-violent manner!<br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/346110/extras/Summon.png?t=1694646699" /><br><br>By bringing sufficient rare sacrificial items to special Summon locations, you can capture the attention of the one of the ARK’s god-like mythical creatures, who will arrive for battle. These gargantuan monstrosities provide an end-game goal for the most experienced groups of players and their armies of tames, and will yield extremely valuable progression items if they are defeated.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/346110/extras/Tribes.png?t=1694646699" /><br><br>Create a Tribe and add your friends to it, and all your tames can be commanded by and allied to anyone in your Tribe.

Distribute key items and pass-codes to provide access your shared village!<br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/346110/extras/RPG.png?t=1694646699" /><br><br>All items are crafted from Blueprints that have variable statistics and qualities, and require corresponding resources. More remote and harsh locales across the ARK tend to have better resources, including the tallest mountains, darkest caves, and depths of the ocean! Level-Up your player character by gaining experience through performance actions, Level-Up your tames, and learn new &quot;Engrams&quot; to be able to craft Items from memory without the use of blueprints, even if you die! Customize the underlying physical look of your character with hair, eye, and skin tones, along with an array of body proportion modifiers. As you explore the vast ARK, you'll find clues left by other Survivors who have made the ARK their home in ages past, in the form of collectible detailed 3D &quot;Explorer Notes&quot;. By uncovering all of these, you can begin to piece together the true nature of the ARK, and discover its purpose!<br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/346110/extras/HardcoreMechanics.png?t=1694646699" /><br><br>Everything you craft has durability and will wear-out from extended use if not repaired, and when you leave the game, your character remains sleeping in the persistent world. Your inventory physically exists in boxes or on your character in the world. Everything can be looted &amp; stolen, so to achieve security you must build-up, team-up, or have tames to guard your stash. Death is permanent, and you can even knock out, capture, and force-feed other players to use them for your own purposes, such as extracting their blood to for transfusions, harvesting their fecal matter to use as fertilizer, or using them as food for your carnivorous tames!<br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/346110/extras/ExploreAndDiscover.png?t=1694646699" /><br><br>The mysterious ARK is a formidable and imposing environment, composed of many natural and unnatural structures, above-ground, below-ground, and underwater. By fully exploring its secrets, you’ll find the most exotic procedurally randomized creatures and rare blueprints. Also to be found are Explorer Notes that are dynamically updated into the game, written by previous human denizens of the ARK from across the millennia, creatively detailing the creatures and backstory of the ARK and its creatures. Fully develop your in-game ARK-map through exploration, write custom points of interest onto it, and craft a Compass or GPS coordinates to aid exploring with other players, whom you can communicate with via proximity text &amp; voice chat, or long-distance radio. Construct &amp; draw in-game signs for other players to help them or lead them astray...  And yet.. how do you ultimately challenge the Creators and Conquer the ARK? A definitive end-game is planned.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/346110/extras/LargeWorld.png?t=1694646699" /><br><br>On the 100+ player servers, your character, everything you built, and your tames, stay in-game even when you leave. You can even physically travel your character and items between the network of ARK's by accessing the Obelisks and uploading (or downloading) your data from the Steam Economy! A galaxy of ARKs, each slightly different than the previous, to leave your mark on and conquer, one at a time -- special official ARKs will be unveiled on the World-map for limited times in singular themed events with corresponding limited-run items!

ARK TSOTF is the only Battle Royale that focuses on large-scale creature-army confrontations, combined with a unique Real Time Strategy overlay. By using tactics and strategy to assemble a fighting-force of history’s most powerful primeval creatures, only one tribe will survive!<br><br>Form your tribe and fight in the ultimate battle of Dino Survival! Designed for intense competition and fast-paced dino action, survivors begin their match in a TEK-imbued sky lobby to tribe up. When the battle begins, they’ll fly towards an island aboard a giant Quetzal before ejecting and gliding towards their chosen starting area. Do competitors dash for drops and fight it out? Do they run into the jungle and hide, search for creatures to tame, and rapidly build their Dino Army, or do they die to a pack of curious Compys? Make use of the birds-eye-view mode, which allows you more effectively Command-&amp;-Control your army of dinosaurs, directly possess individual upgradeable creatures, and issue commands to your team as the ultimate strategist.

<tr><td>Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons</td><td>PEGI 16</td><td></td><td>Brothers is presented from a third-person view overlooking the two brothers. The brothers are moved individually by two thumbsticks on the controller. The controller triggers also cause the respective brother to interact with the game world, such as talking to a non-player character or grabbing onto a ledge or object.
<br>
<br>The older brother is the stronger of the two and can pull levers or boost his younger brother to higher spaces, while the younger one can pass between narrow bars. The player progresses by manipulating the two brothers at the same time to complete various puzzles, often requiring the player to manipulate both brothers to perform differing functions (such as one distracting a hostile non-player character while the other makes their way around).
<br>
<br>Should either brother fall from a great height or get injured, the game restarts at a recent checkpoint. All of the in-game dialogue is spoken in a fictional language, thus the story is conveyed through actions, gestures and expressions.</td><td>Starbreeze Studios</td><td>2013/08/07</td><td></td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr>

The most important aspect is the skillful management of urban planning by shaping the grid of streets, placing buildings and their mutual relation. Well-designed city will greatly improve economic efficiency which may convert into city income.

<br>
<b>Diplomacy and politics:</b>
<br>
The governor will face very difficult<b> choices</b> to be made in a constantly changing political environment.

<b>Monuments:</b>
<br>
<b>What would the real Ancient Egypt be without its monumental sacred architecture?</b> There are mastabas, obelisks, Karnak among others, the Ramesseum and of course the pyramids that <b>are waiting to be built</b>. You will be able to <b>observe the slow process of construction</b>. A team of carpenters, masons, architects and ordinary workers will rise building step by step. It will not be just a graphic feature - the building process is costly and will have an impact on the finances or the public mood.
<br>

<br>
<b>War</b>
<br>
Egypt's history is full of clashes of emerging and failing empires. You will have the responsibility of defending cities from foreign military attacks, making plans to attack and joining your forces on Pharaoh's own call.</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr>

<tr><td>Fort Solis</td><td>PEGI 16</td><td></td><td>The story is told across four chapters. Like a Netflix series, Fort Solis can be binged in one intense session, or played chapter by chapter like an episodic TV show.<h4>Welcome to Fort Solis</h4>
Responding to an unusual alarm call from a remote mining base, Jack arrives at the dark and desolate Fort Solis. With storm warnings imminent, he heads inside to make desperate contact. As the night grows longer, events escalate, spiral out of control and the mystery of what happened to the crew begins to reveal itself. The storms is approching, limiting Jack’s escape as he looks to hold out until morning arrives.<h4>Immersive Storytelling</h4>
Fort Solis looks to deliver a high-fidelity experience designed to completely immerse the player in the cast and their long night. With performances from Roger Clark, Troy Baker and Julia Brown, Fort Solis looks to deliver emotion, fear, empathy and much more with every chapter. 
<br>

<br>
Supporting the core narrative are additional instances of story such as audio logs, surveillance footage of past or present events. Accompanying those are video logs recorded by all crew detailing the events before and perhaps even after that night the alarm was triggered at Fort Solis…<h4>Grounded by the visuals </h4>
Fort Solis brings to players, the next level of details, facial and body animations. With the help of Unreal Engine 5.2 Fort Solis realistic universe is brought to life!<h4>An isolated mining complex</h4>
The skeleton of Fort Solis is built above and below ground. The base contains a variety of locations each with their own surface and sub surface levels. Players will be able to explore the isolated storm bearing surface, the creepy service tunnels absent of any light or the multiple departments that help Fort Solis function on a day-to-day basis such as Engineering, Medical and Communications.
<br>
As the story unfolds locations can easily be revisited for additional story context or continue to serve as a backdrop to the fate that awaits Jack with each passing hour.</td><td>Fallen Leaf</td><td>2023/08/22</td><td>2025/11/26 17:39:52</td><td>0</td><td>600</td></tr>

Sort the recovered materials or try to sell them to scrap collectors.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>REMAKE THE GARAGE</strong></h2><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2414010/extras/Banner_Garage_E.gif?t=1710884146" /><br>Go for your hammer and bust open the old walls! You can make rooms bigger by building new ones and installing new roofs and floors. Choose your preferred paint color and soon you'll see new life breathed into the garage!<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>BUY NEW FURNITURE</strong></h2><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2414010/extras/Banner_Garage_F.gif?t=1710884146" /><br>Place a brand new workbench and tool cabinets, as a more expensive preset, or create a collection yourself by laying out tools individually.

Freedom of choice and multiple approaches to run your business and deal with pressure are key ingredients in this game.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1149620/extras/GSS_RENOVATE.gif?t=1698862749" /><br>Buy an abandoned gas station in the middle of nowhere and restore it to its former glory. Get rid of debris and broken furniture, fix up the walls, paint and decorate the place to your liking. <br>Just don’t spend all your cash on the looks right away, you bought a gas station after all. Repair the equipment, buy what can’t be repaired and start serving your customers to earn money for further renovations and improvements.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1149620/extras/GSS_Expand.gif?t=1698862749" /><br>You don’t need to stay small. You can expand your gas station to be able to serve more customers. Also, a gas station is not just about selling fuel. You can expand the array of services that you offer to your customers and thus attract more and more varied customers. <br>You have various expansion options at your disposal, from smaller ones like providing toilets, a simple shop to complement your income up to big ones like an entire workshop to perform car repairs or even a car wash. There are quite a few choices and most of the expansions can themselves be further expanded upon as well. There is so much you can do here.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1149620/extras/GSS_customize.gif?t=1698862749" /><br>Restoring your gas station is one thing, giving it a personal touch another. The game offers a wide array of options to customize what you have already built and lots of decorations to further enhance the uniqueness of the place. Some decorations can be bought, others have to be acquired during gameplay. <br>It is not just about making the gas station look nice. The more impressive your gas station looks, the more customers will be attracted.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1149620/extras/GSS_SERVE.gif?t=1698862749" /><br>Serving your customers is key in running your gas station with success. They all expect to have their cars filled up, their shopping done right away and aren’t that patient even when it comes to repairs of their vehicles. You are going to be dealing with some serious time pressure at peak hours and have to schedule various tasks for when it’s less hectic. Proper time management and choosing the right priorities becomes very important when it comes to keeping your customers happy. <br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1149620/extras/GSS_Hire.gif?t=1698862749" /><br>While you can try, it most cases running a gas station that has been expanded and upgraded offering lots of different services to your customers might be just too much to handle for you alone. This is where employees come into play. You can hire even multiple employees to help you with the various tasks at the gas station. Employees have their own skills and some are better at some tasks than others. Employees also level based on the tasks they perform and become better at them with time. <br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1149620/extras/GSS_Stock.gif?t=1698862749" /><br>You can’t sell what you don’t have. Keeping track of your stock is important and ordering at the right time for the right price helps to keep profits up. To even better use low price opportunities, you can build a warehouse and expand it to allow for larger storage. Keeping a close eye on your stock is crucial as deliveries take time and you really don’t want to run out of goods to sell, not to mention fuel.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1149620/extras/GSS_Management.gif?t=1698862749" /><br>We created the game so that if you like, you can dive deep into management features and micromanage the living you know what out of it.

The prologue offers some of the customization features of the full game to give you a solid idea what types of customizations you can look forward to.

Restoring the gas station to its former glory will cost you a bit, too. Hence any money that comes in becomes crucial. Thankfully you don’t need to wait for the gas station to be fully restored to start earning some money. Some fuel, fixing up the gas pump and you can start serving the occasional customer already. While you can’t offer your customers much else at this point, it’s a start toward a full fledged gas station offering lots of different services.</td><td></td><td></td><td>2021/07/05 10:38:42</td><td>0</td><td>180</td></tr>

Valve's debut title wins more than 50 game-of-the-year awards on its way to being named "Best PC Game Ever" by PC Gamer, and launches a franchise with more than eight million retail units sold worldwide.<br><br>
		NOW. By taking the suspense, challenge and visceral charge of the original, and adding startling new realism and responsiveness, Half-Life 2 opens the door to a world where the player's presence affects everything around them, from the physical environment to the behaviors even the emotions of both friends and enemies.<br><br>
		The player again picks up the crowbar of research scientist Gordon Freeman, who finds himself on an alien-infested Earth being picked to the bone, its resources depleted, its populace dwindling.

		<ul>
		<li><span class="copyHead">Characters:</span> Advanced facial animation system delivers the most sophisticated in-game characters ever seen. With 40 distinct facial "muscles," human characters convey the full array of human emotion, and respond to the player with fluidity and intelligence.</li>

<tr><td>HELLION</td><td></td><td></td><td>Hello space survivors!<br />
<br />
It's been a long time since the ideas of a future multiplayer space survival game were discussed among the founders of Zero Gravity and creators of Hellion. Our journey started with playing with orbs representing the planets, each carefully moved by skilled hands in a simulation of what would later become orbital mechanics in the game. From the very first moment, we wanted to make a complex and realistic simulation of a solar system within a multiplayer sandbox environment. The goal was huge and ambitious and the course set.<br />
<br />
With a full team, it took us less than two years to make our vision into a reality. Hellion was launched in Early Access in February 2017. We succeeded in releasing a game that was almost impossible to be made, often having to cross and bend the boundaries of our game engine – Unity. The start was a little bumpy but soon enough players recognized that our game was providing a unique experience that could not be found in any other game. The support of our players has confirmed that Hellion is truly special and we are very proud of it.<br />
<br />
We are also proud of you – our players. We couldn’t have even dreamed of creating such a dedicated and engaging community as ours is – both on Steam and on Discord. We are grateful for all the support you gave us during these years and for all wonderful adventures we went through while trying to survive Hellion’s gaze. This expedition left a mark on us for life. Together we built the world of Hellion.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, the cruel reality is – not enough players were brought into our world of Hellion to make it commercially viable. After the sloppy start of the game, predominately in terms of bugs and issues, we gave our best to fix the game and add new content via numerous patches and updates. Hellion grew, got better, but is still far from the original idea of what Hellion was meant to be. Factions, additional ships, trade posts, all of this was simply put aside since our team was constantly fighting technical issues, some of which were simply impossible to be solved for good.<br />
<br />
That struggle is coming to an end. At this point, without an influx of new players, the game doesn’t pay for its development. That’s why we had to make some hard decisions…<br />
<br />
<br />
Zero Gravity can’t afford for further development of Hellion. There will be no new updates, bugfixes or any official changes to the game.<br />
However, since the game is playable and we believe it offers a unique gameplay experience, we want to keep it going for players who want to enjoy it.<br />
Hellion will leave Early Access without achieving goals we originally set out to do.<br />
In order to keep the servers up, we will continue selling the game on Steam. Since the game is not fully finished, the price will be lowered to 15 USD (starting tomorrow Oct. 16).<br />
Control over the official servers will be handed to Hellion’s Discord moderators.<br />
Moderators will stay in touch with us for any important events that might occur.<br />
<br />
<br />
We are absolutely aware that many of you will find these news disappointing. This is a hard time for us. We invested a huge amount of effort and work into Hellion and our hearts and minds were in this project for many years. Now, Hellion’s development is coming to an end and we are sad that our vision for the game was not fully realized.<br />
<br />
Once again, thank you for your support, ideas, reports, content you’ve created and everything else you’ve done for this survival expedition. Thank you immensely!<br />
<br />
Yours,<br />

<tr><td>HITMAN</td><td>PEGI 18</td><td></td><td>Become the Master Assassin in an intense spy-thriller story. As Agent 47, you perform contract hits on powerful, high-profile targets in exotic locations around the world. Gameplay focuses on taking out targets in huge and intricate sandbox levels with complete freedom of approach. Where to go, when to strike and who to kill – it is all up to you.
<br>
<br>Hitman is an expanding and evolving world of assassination. The experience began with a Prologue and Paris location in March, continued with Episode 2: Sapienza in April, Episode 3: Marrakesh in May, the Summer Bonus Episode in July, Episode 4: Bangkok in August and Episode 5: Colorado in September. The season finale in Hokkaido, Japan arrived on October 31st.
<br>
<br>HITMAN also features a major live component, which is made up of Elusive Targets, Escalation Contracts, Community-inspired Challenge Packs and Contracts Mode.
<br>
<br>An Elusive Target is the closest thing to the Hitman fantasy that we’ve ever created. These targets will be custom-created characters that are added to existing locations and are only there for a limited time in real-time. You’ll only have one chance to take them down. If they escape, they are gone for good. If you kill them, that’s the way that you killed them. There are no do-overs and no second chances. When an Elusive Target leaves the game world (one way or another) they never return.
<br>
<br>Escalation Mode is something else completely new for HITMAN and was created as a way to regularly provide a fresh challenge to players. You’ll need to master the location as well as the gameplay mechanics to complete a hit that will escalate in difficulty by adding new elements. This mode has a strong focus on having fun with the game mechanics and mixing them up. It’s more about being playful than realistic.
<br>
<br>Contracts Mode returns from Hitman Absolution; Play-to-create, mark your own targets, choose how to kill them and compete against your friends. We will also pick the best of the bunch and put them in the Featured Contracts list so you’ve got something fresh to play whenever you load up the game.</td><td>IO Interactive</td><td>2016/03/11</td><td></td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr>

<strong>One big house, packed with choices</strong>
<br>

<br>
Sweet news! Your buddy Derek invited you to a rager at Madison's house. Surrounded by a group of eccentric partygoers, you must navigate your way through the night - no matter how wild it gets!
<br>

<br>
Step into a sandbox adventure party game where even your simplest choices can impact the game in a magnificent way.
<br>

<br>
Explore thousands of unique branching narratives with fifteen distinct NPCs that react based on your every remark and action, paving the way for tons of hours of unpredictable and hilarious entertainment.
<br>

<br>
House Party’s gameplay starts with the conversations and grows with the decisions made along the way. With no true ending but dozens of stories to navigate, the night is what you make it.
<br>

<br>
<strong>Discover Items & Uncover Wild Interactions </strong>
<br>

<br>
Explore a two-story house jam-packed with hundreds of items to discover, where every object has a purpose and some can be used in a variety of ways.
<br>

<br>
Change the party's music with the mp3 player, invite a surprise guest over with the laptop, enjoy as many drinks as you can (without getting caught), and... well, we'll leave the most exciting surprises up to you to uncover.
<br>

<br>
Show items to NPCs and they may react with varying dialogue or relationship fluctuations. Most of these hidden objects are vital for completing an NPC's personal storyline and winning their approval. Sometimes you don’t even need any items to cause a ruckus.  Play your cards right and maybe you can win them over with your charm alone.

<strong>NPCs (Not-Boring Party Comrades)</strong>
<br>

<br>
You don't have to thank us, but we invited fifteen of our craziest and funniest acquaintances!
<br>

<br>
A new-to-town sorority girl willing to do crazy things to fit in, the most brahsome brah around, a wild mud-wrestling southern belle, a freakishly buff straight-edge dude hawk-eyeing all the booze, and many more hilarious and unique personalities await.
<br>

<br>
Listen closely and the characters will chat about your actions, conversations, and choices, and also provide hints and insights into cracking their stories open. Throughout the night, you may overhear information about their backstories or catch them gossiping about other guests at the party.
<br>

<br>
Every NPC has favorite bands, personal beliefs, friends and enemies, and party goals for the night. Fully-voiced by amazingly talented voice actors and actresses, the partygoers feel vibrant and alive from the moment you set foot through the door.
<br>

<br>
With fifteen of the most interesting, reactive, and hysterical NPC partygoers to ever exist and a rapidly growing roster, there is always plenty of social variety around the house. All of them have inner motivations and strong personal opinions, making them fun to make various choices around and amusing to see interact with one another!
<br>

<br>
<strong>Make Friends, Enemies... or More?</strong>
<br>

<br>
As you navigate the party, your words and actions will dictate whether each NPC digs your vibe or is seconds away from knocking your lights out.  One bad decision might get you beaten to a pulp, while a good choice might result in making an ally that will have your back for the rest of the night.
<br>

<br>
Every response you choose when speaking to an NPC changes how they feel about you. Keep an eye on your social gauges and watch your gameplay impact whether an NPC is crushing on you, feels so-so about you, sees you as a good friend, or hates your guts.  Relationship values, good or bad, may open new doors.  And, whether you're into guy love or girl love, it's possible to win most characters' hearts for steamy romantic fun at this party!
<br>

<br>
NPCs will respond differently whether they like you, love you, or hate you, unlocking or blocking off potential party choices and unique interactions. They also see what you do and hear what you say, so be careful because one small choice can change everything.

<strong>Interact With Celebrity Guests</strong>
<br>

<br>
Ever heard of the Game Grumps? Make the right choices and you may find Dan and Arin landing unexpectedly in the middle of the house party!
<br>

<br>
Explore their unique storyline, watch them hilariously navigate the festivities, and choose from one of the multiple paths to help them get back to their show!
<br>

<br>
Looking for a hot Spanish tutor to hop in and shake things up? Your decisions could make Lety Does Stuff come knocking on the front door. Explore her wild and crazy side story if you want a real taste of adventure!
<br>

<br>
As one of the only indie studios to ever integrate real-life celebrities into a video game, it has been a ton of fun connecting the guests to the story and welcoming the iconic humor and personalities of Dan, Arin, and Lety into the party. 
<br>

<br>
This fall, Doja Cat joins the cast in an expansive all-new optional DLC story! We're excited to welcome the AMA-winning and Grammy-nominated music star into the game and can't wait for Doja Cat's character to ramp up the party even more!

<tr><td>Mable & The Wood</td><td>PEGI 7</td><td></td><td>Mable & The Wood is a Metroidvania where you hunt down massive beasts and, upon destroying them, shapeshift into their forms in order to use their powers to save or destroy the world. Players with less violent intent can find secret paths to complete Mable without killing anything, including bosses. 
<br>

<br>
Unlike most Metroidvanias Mable does not allow you to run, jump and kill on your own. Instead, you must use non-human forms to attack creatures and traverse through difficult challenges. 
<br>

<br>
The strange cult that resurrected you speak of an ancient prophecy that says you will hunt down the great beasts, take their shape, and use their powers to save this dying world. But what if they're wrong? The prophecy is old, and words lose their meaning with time...
<br>

<br>
When the world is falling apart around you, <i>what will you do?</i> In Mable & The Wood, it's up to you to make that choice. You don't have to kill anyone, but you might kill <i>everyone.</i>
<br>

<br>
<b>Will you banish the darkness, or will you become it?</b>

<h4>COMBAT IS MOVEMENT</h4>
The way you move is deadly. Dragging a sword that is too heavy to lift, Mable shape-shifts into a fairy and leaves it where she stood. Recall the sword to your hand once again to slice through any enemies in your path.

When you string together a long, complex string of kills, it feels like something “you” did rather than something the game let you do. When you play it you feel like you’re actually playing a Xiao Xiao stick animation video. We took inspiration from every kung-fu film we’ve seen. Every bit of effort was poured into delivering an easy to play game that was as addictive to play as Tetris.<br><br><strong>Every Press Matters! DO NOT BUTTON MASH!</strong><br><br>One of the biggest challenges we had while making the game is stopping the player from button mashing. When our friends play tested our game they’d instinctively button mash, they couldn’t help themselves. It must have been the many years of playing other brawlers that engraved it in their minds the notion of rapidly pressing buttons to kill your foes. The game’s designed in such a way that if you button mash, you die. Every press matters. Although playing the game should still be simple, you see a bad guy in front of you, you attack him, he dies. If you punch even once when there’s no enemy in front of you, you’re going to miss. If you miss, chances are you’re going to get hit. It’s a simple system but it’s ruthless to button mashers. We spent much time setting up visual and audio queues as well as many warnings trying to steer players away from their natural button mashing tendencies.</td><td>Silver Dollar Games</td><td>2013/09/01</td><td></td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr>

<b>SYMMETRY</b> is a survival management game set in a retro- futuristic, sci-fi universe. Your main goal is to manage the crash survivors and help them withstand the desolate, extremely cold environment in order to fix their spacecraft and escape. The non- obvious plot is accompanied by an atmospheric musical score and graphic design that sustains the harsh and mysterious ambience.
<br><br>
Survivors’ life functions crucial to their existence, such as eating, resting and mental health need to be taken care of. Extreme circumstances may force crew members to develop new skills like botanics or power plant operations, that weren't necessary in their Earthly life. Gathering all the parts required to repair the spaceship becomes a race against time, as extreme weather conditions and life-threatening supernatural activities become more and more present.

While playing The Outer Worlds, the game tracks your experience to find what you aren't particularly good at. Keep getting attacked by Raptidons? Taking the Raptiphobia flaw gives you a debuff when confronting the vicious creatures, but rewards you with an additional character perk immediately. This optional approach to the game helps you build the character you want while exploring Halcyon.

<tr><td>The USB Stick Found in the Grass</td><td></td><td></td><td>It is a bit difficult to classify The USB Stick Found in the Grass as a game; it is more of a combination of a literary work and a forensic puzzle. If you liked A Normal Lost Phone or Her Story, you will probably like TUSFitG. You are given a virtual representation of a USB stick that was found at a scene of a possible crime and you play a police officer trying to solve a case with very limited information. You are not given any tools to do so, but you can use any tools you have on your computer. The USB Stick Found in the Grass is not subject to any intrinsic limitations on which the game is built. Quite the opposite: TUSFitG is as close to the real thing as possible. The USB drive you will be investigating is indistinguishable from a real one. The tools you will be using are real. If something looks like it can be checked, it can be checked. If something can't be checked, it wasn't our intention – it’s simply the result of a built-in technological limitation. Your job is to find what it is all about, if the stick is in any way related to what have happened and IF anything happened.<br />

Steal in free roam sandbox neighborhoods. Observe your target and gather information that will help you with the burglary. Take the challenge and rob the best secured houses. Buy some hi-tech burglar equipment and learn new thief tricks. Sell stolen goods to the passers. Do anything that a real thief does!<br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/704850/extras/Gather-Intel5.gif?t=1698762420" /><br>A good thief always observes his target. What's inside? Who lives there? What's your target day schedule? Find out when the house is empty and does it have nosy neighbours. Choose from lots of possible approaches to prepare the best plan. Many modern devices available in Thief Simulator might come in handy with gathering intel about your target and it's neighbourhood.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/704850/extras/Be-Quick.gif?t=1698762420" /><br>The faster, the better. Find and steal as many valuables as possible in the shortest time possible. Remember that infinite backpacks don't exist. When it's about time you have to maintain cold blood. In every house you'll find tons of useless stuff, which can really slow you down. If you're not sure that you can take some serious money for it, maybe a good idea would be to leave it behind and save space for some expensive goods. If you fill your backpack with worthless items, you may have to waste your time to throw stuff out just to make space for other things. Be careful, cause some things can draw police attention to you!<br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/704850/extras/Flashlight.gif?t=1698762420" /><br>A real, experienced thief can spot places where there's most probability of finding some valuables on the fly.

They will save you some time on lockpicking or hacking. Key near a window or purchase receipts in trash bins. All those things can make life of an aspiring thief so much easier and reduce your burglary time even by a half. Of course, many of them are just useless trash... Or maybe they aren't?<br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/704850/extras/Be_Careful.gif?t=1698762420" /><br>Be careful! In some houses, you can meet unexpected guests. If they catch you in the act, they will call the police. In this case, hide and wait till they stop looking for you or you can always leave the loot and run away as fast as possible.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Check out more great games published by <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/publisher/playway" target="_blank" rel=""  >PlayWay</a>:</strong></h2><br><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/613100/House_Flipper/[img" target="_blank" rel=""  id="dynamiclink_5" >https://store.steampowered.com/app/613100/House_Flipper/[img</a><br><br><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/645630/Car_Mechanic_Simulator_2018" target="_blank" rel=""  ><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/704850/extras/CMS18_head.jpg?t=1698762420" /></a></td><td>Noble Muffins</td><td>2018/11/09</td><td>2025/02/10 17:51:53</td><td>0</td><td>54060</td></tr>

<tr><td>Total Annihilation: Commander Pack</td><td></td><td></td><td><p>
What began as a conflict over the transfer of consciousness from flesh to machines escalated into a war which has decimated a million worlds. The Core and the Arm have all but exhausted the resources of a galaxy in their struggle for domination. Both sides now crippled beyond repair, the remnants of their armies continue to battle on ravaged planets, their hatred fuelled by over four thousand years of total war. This is a fight to the death. For each side, the only acceptable outcome is the complete elimination of the other.
</p>

<p>
 
</p>

<p>
Total Annihilation (TA) is a real-time strategy (RTS) video game created by Cavedog Entertainment under the guidance of lead designer Chris Taylor. It was released on September 30, 1997, and was the first RTS game to feature 3D units and terrain. Two expansion packs were released: The Core Contingency on April 30, 1998, and Battle Tactics exactly 2 months later on June 30, 1998. When TA was released, the minimum computer requirements were a Pentium 100 MHz processor and 16 MB of RAM. Of course, these requirements were for computers in 1997; modern day machines easily exceed those recommended specifications, but it is still recommended to have a 1 GHz processor and 512 MB of RAM for the updated game engine.

</p>

<p>
In the distant future, the galaxy is ruled by a central body of humans and artificial intelligences called the Core (a contraction of "Consciousness Repository"). The Core's technological and economic triumphs have allowed humanity to colonize most of the Milky Way and enjoy peace and prosperity. However, the balance is broken by a technological breakthrough that allows the consciousness of a human being to be reliably transferred into a machine, thereby theoretically granting infinite life, in a process called "patterning." Following a mandate imposed on humanity by the Core requiring everyone to undergo patterning as a public health measure, a rebel band is formed out of colonies from the edges of the galaxy (hence their name, the Arm), whose members refused to leave their natural bodies to join the Core's machines. A war lasting 4,000 years followed, with the Arm mass-producing clones as pilots for its vehicles and the Core duplicating consciousness-embedded microchips to pilot its own machines.

	<li>Epic battles with hundreds of units accompanied by frantic music composed by Jeremy Soule and hundreds of available mods.</li>
	<li>Fully-articulated 3D units and buildings, with a diverse complement of unit types — for example, aircraft, amphibious tanks, infantry bots (kbots), vehicles, hovercraft, ships, submarines, unit production factories, powerful stationary defenses, and long-range weapons. A unique tracking feature allows players to follow single units, entire armies, or even projectiles across the landscape.</li>
	<li>True 3D terrain that units can climb over, into, and around, on extra-large 3D-generated maps. TA runs comfortably in high resolutions and even on modern dual monitor setups, so players can see more of the battlefield.</li>
	<li>Numerous world types to do battle on, such as grasslands, forests, deserts, archipelagos, open water, lava, metal, ice, crystal, acid, and even moons.</li>

	<li>Detailed and exciting campaigns that focus on their respective side's leaders, the Commanders. The stories of either the Core or the Arm start with an effort to defend the protagonist's home world and initiate a turning point in the war, followed by a series of battles on numerous planets and moons (using Galactic Gates as a form of faster-than-light transportation), before a final strike on the enemy's home world: either on the Arm's bucolic Empyrean or the Core's artificial Jupiter Brain world of Core Prime. Mission objectives include protecting a vital structure or area, capturing a pivotal enemy unit, or simply eliminating all enemy units. More powerful units and weapons are gradually unlocked throughout the campaigns after specific missions or events.</li>
	<li>Single-player skirmish battles and full multiplayer support, allowing players to watch and join battles, and form allied teams to share resources, information, and units.</li>
	<li>Highly advanced weaponry, including lasers, energy machine guns (EMGs), starburst missiles, plasma shells, lightning pulses, paralyzers, and nuclear warheads.</li>

<tr><td>Treasure Adventure Game</td><td></td><td></td><td>This game was clearly made with passion. You can see the proof of this almost everywhere. The 2D environments are colorful and enchanting, gameplay feels smooth and polished, not to mention the absolutely huge and very diversified world in which you can spend many hours just exploring. Treasure Adventure Game casts you in the role of a young boy who lands on an island that is a fragment of what was once a continent, destroyed in the war between a demon and a wizard. You accept quests, travel across the oceans, and generally have a bang-up time of being a little boy in a big world, out there looking for treasure and adventure. Your equipment consists of a hat, a parrot, and a boat that appears whenever you touch water. Combine those with the basic platforming abilities like jumping and crawling that you’re familiar with from every platforming game ever, and you’ve got the basics of a phenomenal romp across a huge world filled with treasure, maps, secrets, danger, and triumph.
<br><br>
The music changes with the environments and day-night cycles, enhancing the feel the game is evoking and making you feel immersed in the world as you travel through it. The game has a retro feel, yes, but you really have to see it for yourself to understand what Treasure Adventure Game brings to the table. Since it’s free, of course, there is simply no reason not to!

You are walking down a street you don't recognize, the fog slowing your pace to a crawl as darkness blinds you. You pause and look up to see a house; candles flicker in every window, like a beacon. Climbing the few steps to the front door, you realize many years have passed since it was last opened – it has been sealed with rust and purpose. Inexplicably, just as you know the candles are for you, you know someone waits inside. Someone who has remained in that house since before the iron began to rust. They have been patient. Waiting for over two decades. Waiting for you.

Holly Stonehouse followed the clues from her old family house to finally arrive at the Dark Falls Asylum and again see that someone was there before her, waiting for her. However this time she is no longer a spectator and what follows her is no longer just a shadow - the danger is real as the Asylum comes alive at night. Collecting clues, going through notes and photographs, unlocking devious puzzles and constructing complex chains of adventure actions, help Holly escape the night and find the answers. Was her mother crazy or was there really another sister? Did her mother commit suicide? How could Dahlia “come back” after the fire and who or what is the terrifying thing that Holly saw at Heather's house and that kept following her ever since?

Possess a range of unique alien weapons and use defense strategies like you've never seen before in this genre.<h2 class="bb_tag"><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/408410/extras/tower_defense_header.png?t=1694605085" /></h2><h2 class="bb_tag"><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/408410/extras/xmorph_maze_600x338.png?t=1694605085" /></h2><br>Your goal is to defend the X-Morph harvesters from waves of incoming human forces. Each enemy wave is preceded by a setup phase in which the player can check what types of enemies are going to be attacking him and to observe their paths. There is no time limit for this phase, so the player can carefully plan his defenses or choose to start fighting immediately and place towers when needed during the battle. One of the game's key features is the ability to build towers virtually anywhere on the map and to shape enemy paths by connecting towers with laser fences. The player can choose between building long mazes out of basic towers or placing more advanced towers which are more effective at different types of incoming enemies. Advanced tower types specialize in dealing with specific enemy types e.g. flame towers are great for destroying fast moving ground units, artillery towers are best at countering large groups of slow enemies, anti-air laser is ideal for shooting down heavy bombers.<h2 class="bb_tag"><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/408410/extras/xmorph_shooter_600x338.png?t=1694605085" /></h2><br>As the X-Morph fighter you can engage enemy units directly with a diverse arsenal of weapons. You can morph into four distinct forms which specialize in dealing with different kinds of threats. Each form has a basic attack and a special charged attack mode. The Plasma Fighter is the most universal form - good at destroying both air and ground units. The Dark Matter Bomber is great at decimating groups of ground units. It can also slow down time and release a dark matter bomb that can cut down buildings. The Shredder fighter is perfect for annihilating large numbers of human air units and clearing the sky. Finally, the Laser Destroyer is best for smelting large single units. It can also charge up a gravitational anomaly that sucks in smaller enemy units.  A large variety of weapons and enemies along with a dynamic, fully destructible environment provides a rich arcade shooter experience.<h2 class="bb_tag"><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/408410/extras/enviro_header.png?t=1694605085" /></h2><h2 class="bb_tag"><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/408410/extras/xmorph_destruction2_600x338.png?t=1694605085" /></h2><br>The game's environments are constructed with a lot of attention to detail and they are almost completely destructible. From small picket fences to huge skyscrapers. Any bridge or building in the game can be collapsed and it's destruction is dynamically simulated using realistic physics. The destruction is not only a visual effect as it can significantly influence the layout of the battlefield. The combination of dynamic environments, laser fences and real-time calculated enemy paths creates unique gameplay scenarios.<h2 class="bb_tag"><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/408410/extras/mecha_header.png?t=1694605085" /></h2><h2 class="bb_tag"><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/408410/extras/xmorph_mech_600x338.png?t=1694605085" /></h2><br>Humans are desperate to defend their homeworld. They have created huge, building size, mechanical war machines to fight against each other, but now they will use them to destroy the X-Morph. Each boss fight is unique and heavily influences the gameplay environment. Entire cities will be destroyed.<h2 class="bb_tag"><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/408410/extras/split_header.png?t=1694605085" /></h2><h2 class="bb_tag"><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/408410/extras/xmorph_coop_600x338.png?t=1694605085" /></h2><br>X-Morph: Defence includes a split screen co-op mode. All missions have different gameplay scenarios designed specifically for co-op play. Enemies attack in larger numbers and from new directions making good cooperation essential to winning. In this mode the game can be played in many different ways, one player can focus on optimizing tower placement while the other shoots at enemies or they can both focus their firepower on the strongest attackers.<h2 class="bb_tag"><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/408410/extras/xmorph_menu_600x338.png?t=1694605085" /></h2><h2 class="bb_tag"><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/408410/extras/moregames_exor.png?t=1694605085" /></h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/780310/The_Riftbreaker/" target="_blank" rel=""  id="dynamiclink_2" >https://store.steampowered.com/app/780310/The_Riftbreaker/</a><br><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/220820/Zombie_Driver_HD/" target="_blank" rel=""  id="dynamiclink_3" >https://store.steampowered.com/app/220820/Zombie_Driver_HD/</a></td><td>Exor Studios</td><td>2017/08/30</td><td></td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr>
